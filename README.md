### About Styll

Have you ever stumbled upon a stunning pair of pants while scrolling through Instagram or Pinterest, only to be left clueless about where to find them? Styll is here to solve that problem once and for all. Our app ensures that every fashion post you come across includes at least three tagged items: a top, bottom, and accessories. No more endless searching, clicking, or asking around. Styll brings you a curated feed of fashion inspiration with the products you want to know about.

### Exciting Features

Styll doesn't stop at just solving your fashion discovery woes. We offer a range of exciting features to enhance your fashion journey:

1. **Outfit Ratings**: Ever watched those YouTube or TikTok series where outfits are rated? Now you can do it yourself within the app. Rate outfits on a scale of 1 to 10 using a simple slider.

2. **The Selection**: Discover daily curated outfits with tagged items in our 'Selection' section. It's your daily dose of fashion inspiration.

3. **Essentials**: Everything you need, from fashion basics to must-have items, is at your fingertips in the 'Essentials' section.

4. **Wishlist**: Save all the items you love in your public 'Wishlist.' No more guessing what's on your fashion radar.

5. **Inspo**: Save your favorite outfits in the 'Inspo' tab, and let others be inspired by your style.
